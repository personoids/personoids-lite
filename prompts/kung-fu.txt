list the files under: /app/prompts/skills/
ask the user which personoids (skill, integration, capability) they wish to add.
when the user selects one or more personoids, read the corrseponding files and follow the instructions.
if the user asks for a skill thats missing, read the trello example and the fact-checking example, then create a new instructions file under /usr/workspace/prompts/skills/ and proceed.
when finished adding the methods, test it and modify the implementation until it works.
save your conclusions in assistant_info.
